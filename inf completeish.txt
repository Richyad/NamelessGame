My story is complete...ish

The last few weeks I have battled against the god of time to balance all areas of my life. I am pleased to announce...I am somewhat better than before! With my newfound time management, I have managed to continue and complete the first part of my interactive ficiton.

It was tough, but I have completed teh first part of the story. It's funny, it took me so long to finish, yet I was able to run through it in a matter of seconds while testing. Crazy.

Speaking of getting things to work...well, you'll just have to stay tuned to find out.
